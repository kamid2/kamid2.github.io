        <h1>The Project.</h1>
        <p>
            Rise Up 4 CS is a research initiative that aims to help underrepresented and marginalized high school students in AP Computer Science succeed. After origination and great success at Georgia Tech, Rise Up has moved to the University of Michigan with Professor Barbara Ericson.
        </p>

    <div class="position" role="text">
        <h1>The Position.</h1>
        <p>
            I currently hold the position of an Undergraduate Mentor for the Rise Up research project. Within this role, my team of two fellow mentors and myself lead remote and in-person tutoring sessions for students in AP Computer Science Principles. Additionally, we lead onsite recruiting sessions at local high schools, write code and computing questions for an open-source e-book, mentor high school students, and participate in a student shadowing program where students can come and experience university computing courses for a day.
        </p>

    <div class="goal" role="text">
        <h1>The Goal.</h1>
        <p>
            Upon starting this position, my team had a very clear goal: to run this research initiative with students for the first time since starting the project at the University of Michigan. We were faced with this key question: “what is the most effective way to utilize our skills to get students to commit to a year in the program?”
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="methods" role="text">
        <h1>The Methods.</h1>
        <p>
            To answer our key question, my team formulated a strategy. We were going to send out flyers, reach out to teachers, but primarily go to high school students in their classrooms instead of waiting for them to come to us. Within those classrooms, my fellow mentors and I gave an overview of the program, but also gave our stories as women and other marginalized groups in college computing courses. We answered questions about our own journeys in high school and college, from AP courses, to college applications, to career aspirations. In pouring out a little bit of our own journeys, we saw the students get truly excited about the program. I watched as these kids realized for the first time, “maybe I can do this.” Empathy and genuine connection were the best tools we found to get kids ready to succeed.

        <h1>The Outcomes.</h1>
        <p>
            Through these recruiting methods, we were able to recruit enough students to run the program for the 2019-2020 academic year. We are currently continuing work with tutoring sessions, continuing to develop the e-book, and in the coming months, we will have our first shadowing days for high schoolers.

        <h1>The Learning.</h1>
        <p>
            One of the foundational skills required to be a truly successful user experience designer is empathy. This project has taken my existing passion for genuine connection with others and given me an outlet to make a real impact on high schoolers’ lives. I have been given the opportunity to make empathy a foundational part of my work experience.
