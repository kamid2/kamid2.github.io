        <h1>The Project.</h1>
        <p>
            I was given the opportunity during the summer of 2019 to assist UMSI Professor Cliff Lampe in his research on online misbehavior, specifically focusing on how AI, machine learning, and social chat bots can be utilized to combat it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="goal">
        <h1>The Goal.</h1>
        <p>
            Our initial goal for my research was to gather as many sources as possible on online misbehavior, to inform Professor Lampe’s work developing social chat bots to moderate online content.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="research">
        <h1>The Research.</h1>
        <p>
            The sources I gathered fell into four categories: examples of online misbehavior, impact upon users, platform moderation, and “why people misbehave online”. From there, each broader category had subtopics. The largest number of sources I gathered fell under platform moderation, with subtopics AI and algorithmic techniques for preventing online misbehavior, human moderation, and social chatbots. I gathered my sources from Google Scholar, JSTOR, and ProQuest.

    <div class="outcomes">
        <h1>
            The Outcomes.
        </h1>
        <p>
            At the completion of my research, I created a 34-page source guide for all of the pieces I had gathered, featuring a usefulness outline for each piece.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="learning">
        <h1>The Learning.</h1>
        <p>
            This position was a chapter of growth and learning. I found myself surrounded by information that I had never delved into deeply before, about artificial intelligence, social chat bots, the online disinhibition effect, more types of cyber hate than I could have ever possibly imagined, and much, much more. More than that, I learned a great deal about effective research strategies that I’ve been able to carry forward into my coursework and other positions. There is always something so valuable about a period of growth, and this research position was no exception.
