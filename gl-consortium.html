        <h1>The Project.</h1>
        <p>
            I participated in a multidisciplinary Design Jam, or a 4-hour design challenge, hosted by the University of Michigan’s School of Information in partnership with the Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium. Our goal? To increase water safety in the Great Lakes, in light of nearly 800 Great Lakes drowning deaths since the summer of 2010.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="context">
        <h1>The Context.</h1>
        <p>
            The Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium was created after founder Jaime Racklyeft nearly drowned in a Great Lakes riptide in the summer of 2012. They aim to increase water safety and end Great Lakes drowning, while maintaining safe enjoyment of the water.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="research">
        <h1>The Research.</h1>
        <p>
            Our 6 person team did research on the key issues and facts through presentations by Racklyeft and other representatives from the Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium. From there, we conducted onsite interviews with stakeholders, such as parents of young children, representatives from the Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium, and healthcare professionals.

    <div class="solution">
        <h1>The Solution.</h1>
        <p>
            Our research indicated that one of the most important subgroups of at risk individuals along the shores of the Great Lakes is young children. Therefore, we decided to move forward with a design that addressed the question: “how might we make beaches safe enough for parents, but fun for kids?”

    <div class = "final">
        <img src="images/presentation.JPG" alt = "A large piece of paper shows a hand drawn sign, with 'Marshall the Seagull', a cartoon bird, sporting a life jacket and pointing to a weather gauge that displays low, medium, or high water danger."/>   
    </div>
    <div class="p-and-p">
        <h1>The Prototype, and the Proposal.</h1>
        <p>
            We crafted a prototype of our solution, a live-streaming weather update sign alongside Great Lakes beaches. This sign would pull data from a weather service relating to riptide risk, storm likelihood, temperature, wind speeds, and more and combine those factors into an overall weather “risk” score. This helpful information for parents would be accompanied by our Great Lakes mascot, Marshall the Seagull. Inspired by Smokey the Bear, he would serve the purpose of getting kids excited about the beach but also remember a key part of water safety, wearing a lifejacket around water. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="potential">
        <h1>The Potential for More.</h1>
        <p>
            Because of the way that this design jam was structured, our final product was a prototype that we presented to stakeholders. As a native Michigander who grew up along the shores of the Great Lakes, I would love to come back to this project and make a final solution that would create real strides in reducing the number of Great Lakes drowning victims.
