        <h1>Hey there! Glad you found me. Let's be friends.</h1>
        <p>I’m a Junior in the user experience design track
             of the University of Michigan's Bachelor of Science in Information program.
             I focus on crafting good user experience, writing effective code, 
             and creating streamlined visual design.

    <div class="why" >
        <h1>Why I Design</h1>
        <p>I grew up frantically writing down the words that circled through my 
            mind and drawing flowers on the margins of college ruled paper. 
            Inherently logical yet naturally creative, I spent years developing my writing, 
            argumentative, artistic, quantitative, musical, and analytical skills. Newer 
            to the picture is my love for coding, which has worked itself into so many
            areas of my life, including my current position as a mentor for underrepresented
            AP Computer Science students. You would be equally likely to find me working
            with Python or Javascript, creating graphics on Illustrator, writing poetry,
            or singing with my guitar behind the windows of my favorite coffee shop. 
            My greatest passion is to use these skills to make others' lives a little bit better.
            UX design is the culmination of everything I am. I did not choose to be a UX Designer. 
            Once I discovered it, my passion for good user experience was so great that 
            I had no choice but to make it a reality. 
        </p>

    <div class="outside">
        <h1>"UX Design is the culmination of everything I am."</h1>
        <h1><br>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
        <p>Outside of work and school, I’m an avid runner (I just completed my third 
            half-marathon!), dog person, music enthusiast (my playlists contain everything 
            from the Smiths to Aretha Franklin), and lover of strong coffee.
